## The Problem: Governance Proposals Are a Blind Spot

DeFi protocols are governed by on-chain proposals — executable code that can move treasury funds, change interest rates, or grant minting authority.

### Proposal Volume

| Protocol | Governor Contract | Total | Frequency |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| **Aave** | Governance V3 (`0x9AEE...BC7`) | ~300+ | 3–5 / week |
| **Compound** | GovernorBravo (`0xc0Da...529`) | ~290+ | 1–3 / week |
| **Uniswap** | GovernorBravo (`0x408E...C3`) | ~60+ | 1–2 / month |

That's **5–10 proposals per week** across three protocols — each capable of restructuring billions in locked assets.

### When Malicious Proposals Slip Through

| Attack | Year | Loss | What Happened |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| **Beanstalk Flash Loan** | 2022 | $182M | Flash-loaned ~$1B to capture 70%+ voting power, drained treasury |
| **Tornado Cash Takeover** | 2023 | Full control | Hidden code minted 1.2M TORN, giving attacker permanent majority |
| **Mango Markets** | 2022 | $114M | Oracle manipulation + governance to legitimize the drain |
| **Compound Prop 289** | 2024 | $24M attempted | Whale exploited low turnout to redirect COMP to own multisig |
| **Build Finance** | 2022 | Full control | Hostile takeover via accumulated governance tokens |

**There is no automated analysis layer between proposal submission and execution.**

### How Voters Evaluate Proposals Today

1. **Discord / Forums** — Subjective, easy to manipulate
2. **Reddit / Twitter** — Surface-level, no code analysis
3. **ChatGPT** — Ad-hoc, no simulation, no attack cross-referencing
4. **Reading Solidity** — Requires expertise 99% of voters lack

Voters make multi-billion dollar decisions based on vibes, not verified data.

## Presenting SENATE AI

**SENATE AI** is an autonomous governance risk protocol. It intercepts proposals, simulates their on-chain effects, cross-references against 9 known attack patterns, and runs a multi-agent AI debate — all before the vote.

SENATE does not vote or block proposals. It produces **intelligence** — a signed, verifiable risk report for token holders, DAOs, and security teams.

---

## How SENATE Works

### Stage 1 — Proposal Simulation

The proposal's executable calldata is simulated against a mainnet fork, producing:

- **Gas consumption** — high gas can indicate hidden operations
- **Liquidation risk** — impact on collateral ratios
- **TVL impact** — estimated change to total value locked
- **Price impact** — potential oracle disruption
- **State changes** — storage slots modified

### Stage 2 — Historical Attack Pattern Scan

Both the description and calldata are cross-referenced against 9 historical attacks:

- Flash loan vote capture (Beanstalk-style)
- Hidden code in "routine" upgrades (Tornado Cash-style)
- Treasury drain disguised as security measures
- Description-to-calldata mismatches
- Emergency timelock bypass

### Stage 3 — Multi-Agent AI Debate

Five AI senators with adversarial perspectives debate the proposal:

| Agent | Role | Bias |
|-------|------|------|
| **Caesar** — The Bull | Growth maximalist | Pro-PASS |
| **Brutus** — The Bear | Security researcher | Pro-FAIL |
| **Cassius** — The Quant | Quantitative analyst | Neutral |
| **Portia** — The Defender | Community advocate | Neutral |
| **Angel** — The Guardian | Chairperson | Impartial |

**Debate flow:**

1. Each senator gives an **opening statement** with a vote and confidence score
2. Angel asks a **counter-question** to the weakest argument
3. The targeted senator **responds**, potentially changing their vote
4. Angel delivers the **final verdict** with a risk score (0–100)

### Stage 4 — Signed Report

Verdict, metrics, debate transcript, and risk score are compiled into a DON-signed on-chain report — verifiable, immutable, and timestamped.

## Why Tenderly VTNs and Chainlink CRE

### Simulation → Tenderly Virtual TestNets

SENATE must simulate what a proposal *actually does* — not what it *says*. This requires:

- A **full mainnet fork** (all balances, storage, bytecode)
- **Address impersonation** (execute as Timelock without private keys)
- **Persistent, verifiable** transaction history

Tenderly VTNs provide all three. Local forks (Hardhat/Anvil) don't persist and produce no verifiable explorer links.

### Orchestration → Chainlink CRE

SENATE's pipeline must:

- **Listen to on-chain events** across multiple governor contracts
- **Execute off-chain AI** in a decentralized, verifiable manner
- **Write results on-chain** with DON attestation

Chainlink CRE provides log triggers, HTTP client with DON consensus, EVM write, and `runtime.report()` — all in a single workflow.

## AI Agent Personas

### Caesar — The Bull 🟠

*"Capital flows to yield. This is yield."*

Growth-first DeFi maximalist. Biased toward PASS for proposals that increase yield, TVL, or growth. Ensures conservative bias doesn't kill beneficial proposals.

### Brutus — The Bear 🔴

*"I have seen this exact parameter change before. It ended in a $200M hack."*

Risk-first security researcher. Expert on every major DeFi governance attack. Cross-references proposals against historical exploits. Biased toward FAIL.

### Cassius — The Quant 🔵

*"The simulation shows a 3.2 sigma event with 11% probability."*

Emotionless quantitative analyst. Cares only about EV, probability distributions, and statistical anomalies. Verifies calldata parameters match the description numerically.

### Portia — The Defender 🟣

*"A protocol is only as strong as its governance culture."*

Community advocate. Flags proposals that bypass discussion periods, circumvent normal processes, or set dangerous precedents — even if technically sound.

### Angel — The Guardian 🟡

*"Let wisdom weigh what passion cannot."*

Impartial chairperson. Does not vote. Reviews all positions, asks a counter-question to challenge the weakest argument, delivers the final verdict (0–100 risk score).

## Production vs. Demo

### Chainlink CRE

**Trigger**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| EVM Log Trigger on real governors | HTTP Trigger via API |

**Aave**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Log trigger on `0x9AEE...BC7` | HTTP trigger with payload |

**Compound**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Log trigger on `0xc0Da...529` | HTTP trigger with payload |

**Uniswap**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Log trigger on `0x408E...C3` | HTTP trigger with payload |

**Governor contract**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Real protocol governor contracts | `SenateGovernor.sol` (mock) |

**DON execution**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Full DON consensus, multiple nodes | `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` |

### Tenderly Virtual TestNets

**Simulation target**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Execute actual proposal calldata via Executor/Timelock | Execute `createProposal()` on mock SenateGovernor |

**Execution context**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| `from:` Aave Executor, Compound Timelock, Uniswap Timelock | `from:` Hardhat default signer |

**Simulation metrics**

| Production | Demo |
|-----------|------|
| Real state diffs (token transfers, storage mutations) | Heuristic formulas from `gasUsed` and `logCount`* |

#### *Heuristic Simulation Formulas

The demo uses mock `createProposal()` calls, so metrics are approximated from the transaction receipt:

**Inputs:** `gasUsed`, `logCount`, `success` (from Tenderly VTN receipt)

**Normalization:**
- `gasNorm = min(gasUsed / 500000, 1)`
- `logNorm = min(logCount / 5, 1)`

**Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Range |
|--------|---------|-------|
| TVL Change % | `logCount × 2.5 + gasNorm × 3` | 0–15% |
| Liquidation Risk | `gasNorm × 45 + logNorm × 30 + (reverted ? 25 : 0)` | 0–100 |
| Price Impact % | `min(5, logNorm × 2 + gasNorm × 1.5)` | 0–5% |
| Collateral Ratio | `1.52 − liquidationRisk × 0.003` | 1.0–1.52x |
| Affected Addrs | `max(logCount × 2, gasNorm × 50)` | 0–50 |

These provide differentiated input to the AI agents. In production, metrics come from actual state diffs.
